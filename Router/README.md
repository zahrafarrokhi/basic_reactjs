## install react
```jsx
sudo npm i -g create-react-app
create-react-app hello-word
cd hello-word
npm run start

```
### router

```jsx

npm i react-router-dom
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
```
### Point(Switch => Routes)
```jsx
In react-router-dom v6, "Switch" is replaced by routes "Routes". You need to update the import

import { Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
to

import { Routes ,Route } from 'react-router-dom';

```
